Melbourne is the second largest city in Australia, and its metropolitan area alone is home to more than a million people. (...) In this article we want to take a closer look at how it is to live in central Melbourne by exploring the relationship between wealth, environmental conditions and access to services. Do the rich people in Melbourne have access to more services and a cleaner living environment? And does Melbournes residents care about living next to green spaces? Stay tuned to explore these questions in further detail with us.

We will be using three different public datasets to perform our analysis of Melbourne's living environment. The first one is a housing dataset, which contains records of houses sold in greater Melbourne over a span of XX years. By looking at house prices in different suburbs of Melbourne we can get an understanding of the wealth of the residents living there. The second dataset describes Melbourne's urban forest, by providing information about every tree's location, age and more. This dataset gives an indication about the amount of green spaces available in the city. The third and last dataset we will take a look at is an overview of different services in the city and their location. This dataset provides information about services like transportation, health, schools and recreation.

Let us first explore the data with some maps. Can we see some patterns between the location (and price) of houses and the proximity of green spaces and public services?

The following map shows an overview of houses sold in the city of Melbourne. We only want to investigate houses within the boundaries of the 14 main suburbs in the municipality of Melbourne, and the boundary is shown as a red line here.
